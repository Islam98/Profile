THis repo is for the portfolio mobile first task using front-end.

= You can download repo and simply use the index.html as the start main(home) page, then navigate to either projects or contacts.

= There is a dark theme feature added in each page and pages are connecting together knowing that theme was changed but you should only open one window at a time before changing the theme as multiple windows will lead to a mess of light and dark themes.

= In the projects section there are 4 projects added that I did before, by clicking 'details' under the project title it will navigate to a page that illustrate the project more and have a picture of the project above it, also each project has its own implementation that I uploaded before on github and the link is on each project's page.

= Kindly consider this github link for more info about projects as I uploaded only one image because github link for all these projects contains video link for any of the projects.

= Contact section has two options either send a normal message that I will receive on email using smtp or using my gmail address normally, also there is a phone number of me.
